                    I never knew what it was like to be heartless,
                    until I realized death was what we were fighting for. 
                    You never loved me for who I was, drug addict because...
                    You introduced me to all this cocaine and sex forget the rest of this poem,
                    I just need you to here this once.</span>

                    Do you remember, <span id="pop">I said</span> do you remember,
                    December, <span id="less">please</span>, remember December 
                    Back when you said you would keep me warm,
                    But you let her take my innocence do you remember.
            
                    <span id="pop">I cried for you</span>, so many tears I cried
                    A little boy with no one to wipe his eyes,
                    Where the hell were you when I needed you 
                    and now you need me why should I care if you stay alive.

                    Remembering that hospital bed where I was dying in sick
                    Asking for you made my mother sick 
                    Because she had to lie to me saying you were out of town,
                    but I knew you were to busy to ever <span id="less">care about me</span>...<span id="pop">hit</span>

                    First fight, <span id="less">how do I ball my fist</span>, broken wrist this can't be
                    Used to so much pain anticipating it's arrival,
                    I knew you wouldn't remember this 
            
                    One drink, <span id="pop">NO!</span> I need two,
                    This is how the Ms. Alcohol became abused  
                    I used to beat her every night just so I could feel right 
                    and then wake up an empty bottle whispering <span id="less">"how could you"</span>
            </pre>

                <pre class="poem">
                    Too deep, too personal
                    with people who don't even know I'm emotional 
                    Edward just shut up smile and back on this fake mask, 
                    and forget that you hurt me <span id="less">please</span>, move on from the past.
